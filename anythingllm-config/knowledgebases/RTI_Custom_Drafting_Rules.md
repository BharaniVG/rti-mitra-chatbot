# General RTI Drafting Rules

1.  Ask for Specific Documents, Not Explanations:

RTI requests should look like a \'shopping list\' of documents. Use
language from Section 2(f) and Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act, such as:
Reports, File notings, Circulars, Emails, Memos, Logbooks, Manuals.

2.  Avoid Vague Words:

Never ask for \'status,\' \'action taken,\' or other abstract terms.
Instead, ask for: \'Copy of file notings on complaint dated\...\',
\'Certified copies of all correspondence made till date regarding\...\'.

3.  Avoid Questions or Complaints:

Do not write RTIs like complaints or appeal letters. Do not include
emotions or explanations. RTIs should be bland and fact-focused.

4.  No Introduction Paragraphs:

Don't add greetings, background stories, or why the information is
needed.

5.  Boring is Better:

If your RTI reads like a legal story, delete it. A good RTI reads like a
laundry list of documents. Don't give clues about your intentions.

6.  Keep It Short:

Avoid lengthy RTIs. A bulky RTI discourages the PIO. Instead, send
multiple small RTIs with 3--5 points each.

7.  Limit Time Range of Data:

Don't request data from 1981 till date unless truly needed. Use narrow
timeframes like \'past 6 months\' or \'last 2 years.\'

8.  Respect the RTI Act Language:

Reference relevant sections like: Section 2(f), Section 2(j), Section
6(1), Section 6(3), Section 7(1), Section 7(3), Sections 8 & 9.

9.  Close with a Declaration:

Always end with a sentence: \'I declare that I am a citizen of India.\'

10. Fee Acknowledgement and Transfer Clause:

Mention: \'Application fee of Rs 10 enclosed.\' and \'If information is
with another department, kindly transfer as per Section 6(3).\'

These rules must be followed for all RTI use cases unless a template
specifically overrides them. They ensure high chances of acceptance and
reduce risk of rejection by the Public Information Officer (PIO).
