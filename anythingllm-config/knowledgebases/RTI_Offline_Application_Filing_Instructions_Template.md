### **How to File Your RTI Application Offline**

1. **Print the Application**  
   Print the RTI draft provided above on a plain A4 sheet of paper.  
2. **Fill in Your Personal Details**  
   Enter your full name, complete address, contact number, and the date on the application (if not already included).  
3. **Attach Supporting Documents (if any)**  
   If your RTI draft mentions any supporting documents (e.g., ID proof, previous correspondence), attach clear photocopies of those.  
4. **Identify the Correct Government Office / PIO**  
   Find out which government office your application should be sent to. This is usually the department that holds the information you’re requesting. Address it to the **Public Information Officer (PIO)** of that office.  
5. **Pay the RTI Application Fee**  
   Depending on whether your RTI is for a **Central** or **State Government** department, the application fee and payment method may vary.  
   Refer to this table for details: [RTI Fee Table](https://onlinerti.com/about-rti#rti-rules-table)  
6. **Send the Application via Registered Post or Speed Post Only**  
   Submit the completed application along with any supporting documents and proof of fee payment using **Registered Post** or **Speed Post** from India Post.  
   *Avoid private courier services* — many government offices do **not** accept them beyond the main gate or after entry-level security, whereas India Post deliveries are allowed all the way to internal dispatch sections.  
   **Keep the postal receipt safely**, as it serves as proof of filing and is needed for follow-up or appeal.
